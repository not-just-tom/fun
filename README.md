A selection of fun coding projects for no particular reason:

bus vs me: a simple node weighted graph for distances between bus stops in Bath for the various bus routes and my walking routes, to compare who can get from bus stop to bus stop faster! I used Dijkstra's algorithm (far from optimised) to calculate the minimum-distance path between the 7 nodes.
